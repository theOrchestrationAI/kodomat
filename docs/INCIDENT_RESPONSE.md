# SlavkoKernel Incident Response Plan

This document outlines the procedures for responding to incidents affecting the SlavkoKernel service.

## Incident Classification

### P0: Critical Incident
- **Definition**: Complete service outage or data loss
- **Examples**:
  - API returns 5xx errors for all requests
  - Firestore data corruption
  - Frontend completely inaccessible
- **Response Time**: Immediate (24/7)
- **Notification**: PagerDuty + Slack + Email
- **Target Resolution**: < 2 hours

### P1: Major Incident
- **Definition**: Partial service degradation
- **Examples**:
  - Elevated error rates (>5%)
  - Significant performance degradation
  - Critical feature unavailable
- **Response Time**: Within 1 hour during business hours
- **Notification**: Slack + Email
- **Target Resolution**: < 8 hours

### P2: Minor Incident
- **Definition**: Non-critical bugs or issues
- **Examples**:
  - UI glitches
  - Non-critical feature unavailable
  - Isolated errors affecting few users
- **Response Time**: Next business day
- **Notification**: Slack
- **Target Resolution**: < 1 week

## On-Call Rotation

The on-call schedule is managed through PagerDuty. Each rotation lasts one week, from Monday to Sunday.

**Primary Contact**: Receives all P0 and P1 alerts
**Secondary Contact**: Backup for the primary contact

## Incident Response Workflow

### 1. Detection & Reporting

Incidents can be detected through:
- Automated monitoring alerts (Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry)
- User reports
- Team member observations

### 2. Triage & Assessment

The on-call engineer should:
- Acknowledge the alert within 5 minutes for P0, 15 minutes for P1
- Determine the severity based on impact and scope
- Create an incident ticket in the issue tracker
- Start a dedicated Slack thread in #incidents channel

### 3. Investigation

- Access relevant monitoring dashboards
- Check recent deployments or changes
- Review logs and error reports
- Identify affected components and potential causes

### 4. Mitigation

Apply immediate fixes to restore service:
- Roll back recent deployments if they caused the issue
- Scale resources if needed
- Restart services if appropriate
- Apply temporary workarounds

### 5. Resolution

After service is restored:
- Implement permanent fixes
- Test thoroughly
- Deploy fixes following standard procedures
- Update documentation if needed

### 6. Post-Mortem

Within 48 hours of resolution, complete a post-mortem document:
